Quasar App Extension @vuemodel/supabase
===

# WIP
The underlying library - [@vuemodel/supabase](https://github.com/vuemodel/supabase) - is a work in progress, and likely to change! However, feel free to use this App Extension as a reference for how you might build your own ðŸ˜„

# Install
```bash
quasar ext add @vuemodel/supabase
```
Ensure your credentials are set in `config/supabase.js`

> You'll likely want to pair this with the [vuex-orm AE](https://github.com/ldiebold/quasar-app-extension-vuex-orm) and the [@vueauth/auth AE](https://quasar.vueauth.com/)

# Docs coming soon but...
There's a [video that covers installation](https://youtu.be/bJTz7h3o44I), and much of the API!
Check it out [here](https://youtu.be/bJTz7h3o44I)

# Donate
